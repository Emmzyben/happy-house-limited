<h2>The Benefits of Hiring Professional Mattress Cleaners</h2>
<p>Over time, your mattress accumulates a surprising amount of dust and dirt, creating the perfect environment for bacteria and attracting dust mites. A poorly maintained mattress can lead to allergies, trigger asthma attacks, poor sleep, and other health issues. Accidentally spills, sweat, and bodily fluids can create unpleasant odours and stains. Regular professional cleaning can help address these concerns by:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Effectively Fighting Dust Mites: Dust mites are microscopic pests that thrive in warm, humid environments like mattresses. They feed on dead skin cells and can trigger allergies and asthma. Our deep mattress cleaning procedure effectively removes dust mites and their allergens, promoting a healthier sleep environment.
</li> <li>Eliminating Odours and Stains: We use powerful yet safe cleaning solutions to remove unpleasant odours and tackle stubborn stains like sweat, urine, blood, and vomit. 
</li><li>Extending Mattress Lifespan: Regular cleaning removes dirt and grime that can wear down your mattress’s fabric and filling. Proper cleaning helps your mattress last longer, saving you money in the long run.
   </li>
</ul>
<p>Promoting a More Restful Sleep: A clean mattress free from allergens and irritants can contribute to healthier, more restful sleep, allowing you to wake up refreshed and energised.

   <h3> Deep Mattress Cleaning Tailored to Your Needs</h3>
   <p>We understand that every mattress is unique. We cater to a variety of mattress types and sizes, ensuring a tailored cleaning approach for optimal results. Whether you have a double-sided mattress, a memory foam mattress, a spring mattress, or a king-size bed, our experienced professionals will know exactly how to clean it effectively.
  </p> 
  <p><b>Here’s how we proceed when deep cleaning your mattress: </b></p>  
   <p>  Dealing with surface dirt: The first step is thoroughly vacuuming your mattress, removing dust, debris, and pet hair from the surface and sides.
</p> 

<p>  <b>Stain treatment:</b> If there are unsightly or particularly stubborn stains on the mattress, we will inspect them, choose the most appropriate stain removal formula and pre-treat them before we continue with the deep mattress cleaning.
  </p>
<p> <b> Hot water extraction cleaning (standard method):</b> This method uses a high-pressure hot water solution to penetrate the mattress fibres and dislodge hidden dirt, allergens, and dust mites. The powerful suction removes the solution and the extracted grime, leaving your mattress remarkably clean and mostly dry.
  </p>

 <p><b>Dry cleaning (optional): </b> We offer dry cleaning for memory foam mattresses or those requiring a gentler approach. A powder solvent is applied to the mattress surface, attracting and encapsulating dirt and grime. After that, our technician vacuums the solvent and dirt, leaving the mattress fresh. This method effectively neutralises bacteria and odours while remaining safe for all types of mattresses.
  </p>
  <p> <b>Fabric Protection:</b>  As an additional mattress care step, we can apply a protective layer to the fabric. The stain-repellent product prevents spills from becoming permanent stains, making future cleaning easier.

  <h2 style="text-align: center;border-bottom: 1px solid grey;">FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h2>
  <p><b>Q: How do you clean mattresses?</b></p>
  <p>A: We use hot water extraction for deep mattress cleaning – the same method we use to clean upholstery and carpets. Hot water extraction is also known as steam cleaning but is more advanced. It couples high pressure with hot water to agitate fibres and speed up the reaction time. Hot water and cleaning solution are sprayed into the fibres, and a suction hose extracts up to 95% of the liquid along with dirt, dust, and grime. The process is suitable for mattresses finished with synthetic and natural fabrics.</p>
  
  <p><b>Q: Is hot water extraction effective for mattress cleaning?</b></p>
  <p>A: Yes, we start deep cleaning the mattresses by pre-treating all stains with advanced stain removal products. Thanks to the hot water extraction unit, the cleaning solution penetrates the fabric of a mattress under high pressure. The procedure eliminates bacteria, germs, and dust mites while removing grime and debris.</p>
  
  <p><b>Q: Do you bring your own cleaning supplies?</b></p>
  <p>A: Yes. All cleaning materials and equipment are included in the mattress cleaning price.</p>
  
  <p><b>Q: Do your mattress cleaning products pose any risk to my family and pets?</b></p>
  <p>A: All our cleaning products are eco-friendly, non-toxic, and entirely safe for humans and pets. They won’t harm your loved ones nor leave any harmful residue behind.</p>
  
  <p><b>Q: How long does it take to clean a mattress?</b></p>
  <p>A: A standard double mattress can take up to an hour to clean, but the duration may vary depending on the size and extent of stains.</p>
  
  <p><b>Q: Can you remove all stains from the mattress?</b></p>
  <p>A: Our cleaning methods ensure we remove all types of stains and odours. However, stains that are very old or have been treated improperly may be impossible to remove fully.</p>
  
  <p><b>Q: Are your technicians insured and reliable?</b></p>
  <p>A: Our cleaners are vetted, insured, and certified for their specific skills.</p>
  
  <p><b>Q: How can I pay for the mattress cleaning? Do you require a deposit?</b></p>
  <p>A: We don’t require a deposit. You can make a bank transfer or a card payment.</p>
  
  <p><b>Q: Do I have to pay for parking or congestion charges?</b></p>
  <p>A: When you book our mattress cleaning service, please keep in mind that a few additional charges may apply. Our cleaners will make every effort to find a free parking spot when they arrive. However, if none are available, you will be responsible for paying the parking fee while our technicians clean your mattress. Depending on the day and time and where your property is located, you may have to pay for parking, congestion, or ULEZ charges.</p>
  
  <p><b>Q: Should there be a water source for the mattress cleaning service? Should there be hot water, or is cold water sufficient?</b></p>
  <p>A: We need access to a water supply to run the hot water extraction machine and deep clean your mattresses. Hot water is preferred but not required.</p>
  
  <p><b>Q: How long do I need to wait before using the mattress after hot water extraction?</b></p>
  <p>A: Our machines are designed to remove approximately 95% of the moisture from the mattress after hot water extraction. Typically, the mattress takes 6 to 8 hours to fully dry. If we clean it in the morning, you can expect to use the mattress by the evening. We recommend opening all windows and turning on the heating to speed up the drying process.</p>
  
  <p><b>Q: How often should I have my mattress professionally cleaned?</b></p>
  <p>A: We recommend that you get it done every six months. Professional cleaning removes allergens, dust mites, and other bacteria that can accumulate in your mattress. Regular deep cleaning also helps maintain your mattress in good condition and prolongs its life.</p>

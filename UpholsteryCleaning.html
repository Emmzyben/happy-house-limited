     <h3>How Do We Clean Upholstery?</h3>   

<p>The Happy House Cleaning Services team uses hot water extraction for cleaning domestic upholstery. However, our cleaners add some good old-fashioned hard work and attention to detail to ensure we provide the best possible care for your furnishings. Our trained technicians can recommend the most suitable method for any fabric or couch for the best results. Here is a list of the most common cleaning codes:
</p>
<p>S – means solvents only. Dry clean, no water.</p>

<p>X – means vacuum or brushing only. Do not attempt to clean — very rare code.</p>

<p>S/W – means dry foam from a mild detergent. Safer than S, but still use dry treatment.</p>

<p>W – means water. It could be safely steam cleaned.</p>

<p>If the furniture label is missing or doesn’t contain an upholstery cleaning code, don’t worry. Our trained technicians will recommend the most suitable approach for your sofa’s fabric or material.

  <h2 style="text-align: center;border-bottom: 1px solid grey;">FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h2>
  <div>
    <div>
      <p><b>Q: What is a deep upholstery cleaning?</b></p>
      <p>A: Upholstery cleaning is the treatment of any upholstered furnishing in your home. This procedure can be used to deep clean sofas, chairs, armchairs, curtains, drapes and other upholstered items.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
     <p><b>Q: Can you remove stains from the upholstery?</b></p> 
      <p>A: The effectiveness of the stain removal products depends on what caused the stain. However, in most cases, we can clean even old stains without leaving a trace. Although not 100% of the spots can be cleaned, we will do our best to remove them from your upholstery.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
     <p><b>Q: Do you use professional equipment?</b></p> 
      <p>A: We do. We work only with professional-grade cleaning tools and machines, and use advanced detergents and solutions. We work with the brands Prochem and Karcher, which are the leading suppliers to the cleaning business worldwide. Prochem products are eco-friendly, non-toxic and safe for children, allergy sufferers and pets.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
     <p><b>Q: Do you steam or dry clean the upholstery?</b></p> 
      <p>A: For most furnishings we steam clean and shampoo the fabric, using safe, eco-friendly solutions. However, we use dry cleaning methods for delicate upholstery materials.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
     <p><b>Q: Do you use chemicals during the upholstery cleaning service?</b></p> 
      <p>A: Yes, we do. However, all the detergents we use are entirely non-toxic and appropriate for cleaning domestic furniture. If you are sensitive to particular chemicals, please notify us when you make your booking so we can apply an alternative solution to clean your furnishings.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p><b>Q: How long does it take for my upholstery to dry after steam cleaning?</b></p>
      <p>A: Upholstery made from wool or wool blends takes between four and seven hours. All other types of fabrics should be entirely dry after approximately three to six hours.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
     <p><b>Q: Can I book upholstery cleaning on weekends?</b></p>

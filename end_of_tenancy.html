  <h2 style="text-align: center;border-bottom: 1px solid grey;">FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h2>
  <p><b>Q: What does the end of tenancy cleaning service include?</b></p>
  <p>A: To see what is included in the service, please refer to our detailed End of Tenancy Cleaning Checklist.</p>
  
  <p><b>Q: Do you provide all cleaning equipment and materials?</b></p>
  <p>A: The end of tenancy cleaning team brings all the tools and products necessary for the completion of the job.</p>
  
  <p><b>Q: What guarantees that the professional end of tenancy cleaning service will restore the property to the highest standards?</b></p>
  <p>A: Our end of lease cleaning professionals strictly follow an agency-approved list of tasks when cleaning your rental housing, to ensure that every area of the property will be cleaned to the highest of standards before you relocate. This way, The Happy House Cleaning Services technicians make sure that you will obtain your deposit money back. However, if you are not happy with the result, you can contact us within 72 hours and we will arrange a re-clean of the property.</p>
  
  <p><b>Q: Do you clean the outside of the windows?</b></p>
  <p>A: Yes, we can provide exterior window cleaning, but this job isn’t a part of the end of tenancy cleaning service. If you want to include full window cleaning in your service, it will be charged as an additional service. You will, however, benefit from a special discount for booking combined services from Happy House Cleaning Services.</p>
  
  <p><b>Q: Can you clean the oven too?</b></p>
  <p>A: Yes, the cleaning of the oven is included in our end-of-lease service. Both inside and outside of the oven will be deep-cleaned and treated with professional-grade cleaning products.</p>
  
  <p><b>Q: Do you clean carpets and upholstered furniture?</b></p>
  <p>A: All carpets and upholstered furniture will be cleaned with a powerful vacuum. If you want these furnishings done up to professional standards you can add upholstery cleaning and/or carpet cleaning to your booking, at preferential prices for using our combined services.</p>
  
  <p><b>Q: Do I have to defrost my fridge and freezer in advance?</b></p>
  <p>A: To ensure the best possible results for your move, please make sure to defrost the fridge/freezer about 24 hours before the service begins. If the fridge/freezer is still frozen when the tenancy cleaners arrive, they might not be able to clean it properly.</p>
  
  <p><b>Q: How many cleaning technicians will you send?</b></p>
  <p>A: The number of cleaners engaged will depend on the size of the rental property. We will send as many technicians as is necessary to complete the end of tenancy service in a timely manner.</p>
  
  <p><b>Q: What happens if a cleaning technician damages something during the service?</b></p>
  <p>A: You can rest assured that all of our technicians are careful and diligent in their work, so such occurrences are rare. However, all end of lease cleaners are fully insured so you will receive suitable compensation in the unlikely event of any damage being caused.</p>
  
  <p><b>Q: What happens if the team misses to clean something?</b></p>
  <p>A: Although it’s very unlikely that things will be missed during the initial visit, all you need to do is notify us within 72 hours and we will send a technician to re-clean the rental property.</p>
  
  <p><b>Q: Do you require any deposit?</b></p>
  <p>A: No, we don’t. The payment for the service is usually arranged upon job completion and after the property passes the move-out inspection by the agency or the landlord. You’ll only pay for the end of tenancy cleaning service in advance if you prefer to pay with a card.</p>
  
  <p><b>Q: Do I have to pay extra for any parking fees or congestion charges?</b></p>
  <p>A: Parking is the only thing that may require an extra expense for your cleaning service. Our cleaners will always try to find a parking spot free of charge when they arrive. If there is none available, you will be required to cover the cost of the parking fee for the time our team spends cleaning the property. If your home is within the Congestion Charge zone, you will be asked to meet this charge as well. To be sure of avoiding this, book your cleaning service at the weekend or on a bank holiday, when Congestion Charge fees do not apply in London.</p>
  
  <p><b>Q: Can you perform the service while I am not in the property?</b></p>
  <p>A: Yes, we can do the end of tenancy cleaning while you are away. However, you will need to arrange a key pick-up. You can also pay for the service with a card while you are away.</p>
  
  <p><b>Q: Should I prepare the property before the arrival of the cleaning team?</b></p>
  <p>A: This is not necessary. The only condition is to leave the rental clear of all things that don’t originally belong there. All your items and furnishings should be removed from the property. When this is not possible, you can collect your belongings together in one place – for example, you can put them on a bed or in a wardrobe, so they don’t stand in the way of the end of tenancy cleaning team.</p>

    </ul>
    <p>If you want a deep cleaning service for carpets and upholstery, you can book that separately, with a discounted price for booking combined services with The Happy House Cleaning Services.</p>
    
    <p><b>Q: Do I have to provide any cleaning materials?</b></p>
    <p>A: No, the after builders cleaning team will bring all products and equipment necessary for completion of the job. All the materials are included in the price of this service.</p>
    
    <p><b>Q: Can I book an after builders service if the builders haven’t finished with the work yet?</b></p>
    <p>A: We strongly recommend booking the after builders cleaning service about 24 hours after the builders have completed their work on your property. We will be happy to clean some areas of the property while builders are still working on other parts, in order to give you a clean area. However, please keep in mind that we can’t guarantee the best results if there is more construction/renovation work to be done after the cleaning service.</p>
    
    <p><b>Q: Do you use chemicals?</b></p>
    <p>A: We use professional-grade cleaning products designed for use in both domestic and commercial properties. However, if you are sensitive or allergic to certain chemicals, please tell us when you book our after builders cleaning and we will make sure that the service is carried out with alternative products.</p>
    
    <p><b>Q: Do I need to provide a parking space for the team?</b></p>
    <p>A: Yes. Please make sure there is an available parking place near your property. You can either find a parking spot yourself or choose to have the fee added to the final bill.</p>
    
    <p><b>Q: Do you require a deposit?</b></p>
    <p>A: No, we don’t. Usually, the payment is settled upon job completion. However, if you prefer to pay with a card, the transfer should be done before our team starts work.</p>

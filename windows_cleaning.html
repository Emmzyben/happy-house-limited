   <h3>How Does Our Team Clean Windows?</h3> 
<p>    We employ two primary cleaning methods to ensure a flawless finish on all your windows. Both methods deliver excellent cleaning results.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Pure water treatment:</strong> Our advanced water-fed pole system allows us to reach windows up to the fourth floor without ladders. This eco-friendly method utilises purified water to remove dirt from the glass without leaving streaks or residue. It’s ideal for high-rise buildings, retail units, and office windows. Our cleaners use a 22m-long carbon fibre pole attached to a tank of purified water in our van. The technicians use this method to remove dirt, minerals, and chemicals from your glass. Using this method allows us to reach windows up to four storeys from the ground.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Traditional window cleaning:</strong> Hundreds of customers around London still prefer the good old ladder-and-squeegee cleaning method. Unlike the water-fed pole method, our window cleaners use detergents to remove dirt, stains, and fingerprints from glass. The traditional method is perfect for internal and external windows accessible from the ground or second floor using ladders.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
<h3>Please note:</h3>

   <p> Parking within 30 metres of your property is necessary when booking pure water window cleaning.</p>

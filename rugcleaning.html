  <h3>What Is Hot Water Extraction Rug Treatment?</h3>  
<p>Hot water extraction, known widely as deep steam cleaning provides excellent results for most types of rugs. A solution of water and cleaning detergent heated to a high temperature is shot onto the rug and simultaneously extracted by a powerful suction attachment. This rug cleaning method doesn’t leave it soaking wet, which makes it suitable for commercial properties, offices, hotels, etc. Both manufacturers and official industry bodies such as NCCA and IICRC favour this method as superior to other deep treatments for textile floorings.

  <h2 style="text-align: center;border-bottom: 1px solid grey;">FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h2>
  <p><b>Q: How do I prepare my rug for professional cleaning?</b></p>
<p>A: No special preparation is needed before the rug cleaning. You could remove any heavy furniture from the rug to make access to the flooring easier. However, our cleaners can also move light furniture before the cleaning.</p>

<p><b>Q: I have stains on my carpet that stuck through several professional cleaning sessions. I’d like to know whether your company gives a guarantee for stain removal.</b></p>
<p>A: No, we cannot give a 100% guarantee for stain removal of old stubborn stains. Still, we use professional-grade stain cleaners designed to remove various stains from different types of rugs. So we will be able to remove the majority of your rug stains. The cleaner will estimate more accurately once they arrive and inspect the carpet.</p>

<p><b>Q: How long will it take for an average rug to dry completely after a professional cleaning?</b></p>
<p>A: If the room is well-ventilated, the rug should take around three hours to dry. The hot water extraction machines we use to clean rugs extract about 95% of the water used during the procedure. We also can bring powerful fans upon request to speed up the drying process.</p>

<p><b>Q: Can you provide me with an eco-friendly rug cleaning too?</b></p>
<p>A: Yes, all the cleaning solutions used by the company are Prochem certified and continuously tested for the safety of people, animals and the environment. So, you can be sure that any solution used during the rug treatment by The Happy House Cleaning is environmentally friendly.</p>

<p><b>Q: Can you clean my expensive antique rug safely?</b></p>
<p>A: Our rug cleaning technicians are well-trained and experienced professional cleaners. Also, all of our cleaning services are fully insured. When we treat valuable antique rugs, we do a spot test on a hidden rug area before cleaning it to prevent breakage of the fibres, colour bleeding, and other damage. So, you can rest assured that your rug is in safe hands with us.</p>

<p><b>Q: I am quite busy during the weekdays. Can I book rug cleaning for the weekend?</b></p>
<p>A: Yes, you can. We provide a professional rug cleaning service every weekday, including on public holidays and weekends. You can also book the service in the evening hours. Don’t hesitate to contact us – our friendly office staff will provide information on the available booking slots.</p>

<p><b>Q: Should I remove my pets from the house during the rug cleaning and drying?</b></p>
<p>A: The solutions we use are completely safe for pets and people, so there is no problem if your pets remain in your flat. However, keeping them out of the room during the rug cleaning is best to avoid accidents with the cleaning equipment and tools. Also, it is a good idea to keep people, pets and furnishings off the cleaned rug until it dries completely so the fibres don’t get creased.</p>

<p><b>Q: For years, we’ve been heavy smokers. Can you remove the strong cigarette smell from my rug?</b></p>
<p>A: The hot water extraction removes dirt, dust, and harmful bacteria from your rug. The cleaning solutions that we use help deal with stains and odours. We can also apply a specialised carpet deodorant upon request, leaving your rug smelling fresh and clean.</p>

<p><b>Q: How often should I deep clean my rug to keep it looking nice and maintain good air quality in the house?</b></p>
<p>A: Well, it depends on the type of your rug, as well as on other factors, such as:</p>
<ul style="color: #5c5a5a;">
  <li>how many people live in the home;</li>
  <li>are there any allergy or asthma sufferers;</li>
  <li>are there pets in the house;</li>
  <li>is your rug placed in a high-traffic area;</li>
  <li>do you smoke at home;</li>
  <li>and many more;</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, deep cleaning your rug at least once every 6 months should be enough to keep it nice and fresh and maintain the healthy air quality in your home.</p>

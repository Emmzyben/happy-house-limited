   <h3> How Do We Clean Your Home Carpets?</h3>
   <p>Our carpet cleaners treat carpets using the most efficient and thorough method: hot water extraction.
    </p> 
   <p> Both manufacturers and industry organisations such as NCCA and IICRC favour the hot water extraction method (also known as carpet steam cleaning). This method breaks the bonds between dirt and fibres, with impressive results and it removes stubborn stains or other blemishes. Our deep clean method results in refreshed carpets for a long time, and you can further enhance the effect with our Scotchgard stain protection service.
    </p>
  <p> We use cutting-edge professional steam cleaning equipment from leading manufacturers in the industry, such as Prochem and Karcher.
    </p>

  <h2 style="text-align: center;border-bottom: 1px solid grey;">FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h2>
  <p><b>Q: How do you clean the carpets?</b></p>
  <p>
    A: The deep carpet cleaning method we use is hot water extraction. This procedure is used to treat both carpets and upholstered furniture. Although this treatment is widely known as steam cleaning, it is more advanced than a regular steam cleaning process. Hot water extraction couples high pressure, for agitation of the carpet fibres, with hot water to speed up the reaction time. This is how professional steam carpet cleaning works:
  </p>
  <p>
    A high-pressure nozzle shoots a powerful stream of hot water and cleaning product deep into the fibres of the carpet. A suction hose works simultaneously to pull back the water and cleaning solution along with any soil, dust and grime, to leave the carpet deeply cleaned. The nozzle can suck up around 95% of the liquid.
  </p>
  <p>
    Professional steam carpet cleaning is appropriate both for synthetic rugs and those made of wool fibres.
  </p>
  
  <p><b>Q: Which treatment is better, steam or dry cleaning?</b></p>
  <p>
    A: We strongly recommend steam carpet cleaning, as this method delivers the best results, both for hygiene and for the appearance of your floor piece. Hot water extraction removes unpleasant odours and unsightly stains and kills bacteria, which makes it particularly suitable if there are allergy sufferers in your household. Dry carpet cleaning methods are used mostly for delicate floorings that cannot be treated with water.
  </p>
  
  <p><b>Q: How long will it take for my carpets to dry after a steam cleaning?</b></p>
  <p>
    A: The drying time depends on the type of the carpet fibres, but it usually takes between four and six hours. Please avoid walking on the carpet until it has dried completely, to prevent re-soiling and slips.
  </p>
  
  <p><b>Q: What kind of carpet cleaning products do you use?</b></p>
  <p>
    A: We always favour non-toxic, eco-friendly cleaning products that are entirely safe for both humans and pets.
  </p>
  
  <p><b>Q: What stain protection product do you offer and why should I use it?</b></p>
  <p>
    A: We can apply a high-quality fibre stain repellent that can noticeably prolong the cleanliness of your carpet after a professional cleaning service. This product will also significantly extend the life of your textile flooring, especially in high-traffic areas.
  </p>
  
  <p><b>Q: Do you move furniture?</b></p>
  <p>
    A: The professional carpet cleaning service requires just one technician, so they are only able to move light furniture pieces (as long as this doesn’t pose any extra risks for their safety).
  </p>
  
  <p><b>Q: Are your technicians insured and reliable?</b></p>
  <p>
    A: Yes, they are. All Happy House Cleaning Services team members are vetted and insured. Our cleaners have undergone extensive professional training and have certificates for their specific skills.
  </p>
  
  <p><b>Q: Do you require a deposit for your carpet cleaning service?</b></p>
  <p>
    A: We don’t require a deposit, as the payment is settled upon job completion. You only need to pay for the service in advance if you prefer to pay with a card.
  </p>
  
  <p><b>Q: Do I have to pay extra for any parking fees or congestion charges?</b></p>
  <p>
    A: Parking is the only thing that may require an extra expense for your carpet cleaning service. Our cleaners will always try to find a parking spot free of charge when they arrive. If there is none available, you will be required to cover the cost of the parking fee for the time our technician spends cleaning the carpet. If your home is within the Congestion Charge zone, you will be asked to meet this charge as well. To be sure of avoiding this, book your carpet cleaning service at the weekend or on a bank holiday, when Congestion Charge fees do not apply in London.
  </p>
  
  <p><b>Q: Can you perform the carpet cleaning while I am away from the property?</b></p>
  <p>
    A: Yes, we can clean your carpets while you are away, but you will need to arrange a key pick-up. You can also pay for this service with a card.

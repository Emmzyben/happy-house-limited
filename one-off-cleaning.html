        <h3>THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN END OF TENANCY CLEANING AND ONE-OFF DEEP CLEANING</h3>
    </div>
</div>
<div id="talk" style="margin-top: 0;">
<div>
  <h3>What is a one-off deep clean?</h3>  
  <p>A one-off deep clean is a tailored cleaning service available to all of our cleaning customers. Our deep clean team can come into your home and give it a thorough clean from top to bottom. This is perfect for if you’ve just moved into a new property and the last owners have left it in a bit of a state. It is also great if you haven’t
    had too much time to clean recently and need a helping hand getting your home back to your high standards.</p>  
    
  <p>The best part about our one-off deep clean services is that they are totally tailored to your needs. So, if you need our deep clean team to come in and clean your carpets and upholstery while ensuring that your home is dust-free, they can. If you don’t need the carpet cleaning, but do need hardwood flooring mopped and disinfected, as well as the fridge and the oven cleaning, the deep clean team can do it.
    </p>  
  <p>Our one-off deep clean services are done with all of your belongings in place. We will, of course, reach neglected areas during the cleaning process to ensure your home is as clean as possible. However, there is no need to remove any of your belongings, we will clean them, under them and around them.
   </p>   
  <p>The Happy House Cleaning Services can provide all the necessary cleaning materials if requested; otherwise you will need to supply cleaning products and equipment for our cleaners. We require a minimum of three hours for cleaning a house or flat, but time requirements vary depending on property size and the degree of accumulated dirt and dust.
</p>

    <h3>What is end of tenancy cleaning?</h3>
    <p>    Our end of tenancy cleaning services are much the same as our one-off cleaning services. However, they involve a complete clean of your rented property to prepare it for handing over to your landlord. We come to the address after your belongings are removed to do this cleaning. Nevertheless, we can still provide carpet cleaning services and upholstery cleaning if the rented property needs it.
</p>
  <p>    We also deep clean the fridge, freezer and oven to achieve professional cleaning results. End of tenancy cleaning also includes tending to all places commonly missed in regular cleaning, like skirting boards, kitchen cupboards, behind the toilet, on top of doors, etc. Our team uses the The Happy House Cleaning Services comprehensive end of tenancy cleaning checklist to ensure the cleaning is done to the highest standards that landlords and estate agents require.
    </p>  
<p>    We know the requirements of the inventory clerks inspecting your property when you move out. Our goal with the end of tenancy cleaning is to ensure your landlord ends up with an immaculately clean and tidy property and you receive as much of your deposit as possible.
 </p>
 <p>    If requested, we can provide all the necessary products and tools for your end of lease cleaning. Alternatively, you can supply cleaning products and equipment for our cleaners. The minimum cleaning time for a comprehensive end of tenancy cleaning for a house or flat is 3 hours, however the time to complete the service may vary depending on the rental property’s size and whether you’ve added carpet cleaning, upholstery cleaning, or another professional service to your booking.

  <h2 style="text-align: center;border-bottom: 1px solid grey;">FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h2>
  <p><b>Q: Is it possible to get some discount?</b></p>
  <p>A: Yes, you can. If you book oven cleaning + another of our services, you get a discounted price. A lot of our clients prefer to combine the cleanup of their cooker with a fridge or dishwasher cleaning, but you can add any other of our services, and you will still get a reduction of the price.</p>
  
  <p><b>Q: Should the oven be turned on and hot before the clean?</b></p>
  <p>A: No. The appliance should be turned off and cold when the oven cleaner arrives.</p>
  
  <p><b>Q: Do you bring all the necessary equipment and detergents?</b></p>
  <p>A: Yes, we provide everything necessary for an impeccable oven cleaning job.</p>
  
  <p><b>Q: Do you clean hobs, extractors, fridges, and other white goods?</b></p>
  <p>A: Yes, we clean all kinds of kitchen appliances. Contact us for additional information about our white goods cleaning services.</p>
  
  <p><b>Q: Should I be worried about cleaner fumes after the oven cleaning service?</b></p>
  <p>A: The cleaning products we use do not contain any dangerous chemicals, so you can use the oven right after the service.</p>
  
  <p><b>Q: Do you clean AGA and other types of heat-storage range cookers?</b></p>
  <p>A: All the technicians in our team are well-trained to clean AGA, Rayburn, Rangemaster, and any other type of heat-storage range cookers. However, it is necessary to turn off the AGA cooker at least 24 hours before the oven cleaning service as it will need time to cool off completely before the technician arrives.</p>
  
  <p><b>Q: Exactly how long does it take to clean my oven fully?</b></p>
  <p>A: The time we need to clean an oven depends on the size and condition of the appliance. However, our technicians will be able to be more precise and give you a time estimate once they are on site. The same applies to fridge, hob, extractor, and any other white goods cleaning service.</p>
  
  <p><b>Q: Do you clean after yourselves?</b></p>
  <p>A: Usually, there is no need to do this. All cleaning technicians place protective sheets to cover the working area and wear overshoes to keep your floors and carpets spotless. However, if they do mess something up, they will clean afterwards to make sure your place is immaculate after the appointment.</p>
  
  <p><b>Q: What is your coverage?</b></p>
  <p>A: We work in all areas in London (within the M25 circle). If you are not sure whether we cover your area, please contact us – we will be happy to check for you.</p>
  
  <p><b>Q: Do I have to give access to electricity or a hot water source for the oven cleaning service?</b></p>
  <p>A: Yes, please do. We need access to hot water to effectively remove all of the grime and grease off your oven. As for the electricity, we need a power source to do the testing of the appliance before and after we are ready with the cleaning job and make sure everything works properly.</p>
